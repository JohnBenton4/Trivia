# Trivia
We had the idea to create a website with two different API's to address the "problem" of people either feeling happy or sad. As a user opens the website they are greeted by a simiple question of how they are feeling that day. Depending on their response, Happpy or Sad, they will be taken to a joke and a trivia question. 

Our hope is that someone who is feeling sad will have their frown turned upside down. If the first joke doesn't improve their mood then they can click to get another joke. This cycle continues until they feel better. Once they feel better they can either continue enjoying the jokes or go back to the home screen, and click on the happy face to try their hand at some trivia.

Similarly, someone who feels happy will be challenged with a trivia question. Getting the question correct will hopefully further their good mood. Getting the question wrong will give them the opportunity to try another question or go back to the home screen, and if they are now in a bad mood, they can click the sad link and be taken to a joke. 

This could provide an endless emotional rollercoaster and hours of entertainment.
